## Project Overview

This project aims to identify and classify misinformation related to vaccines from text data, leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes pre-trained language models fine-tuned on vaccine misinformation datasets to automatically detect false or misleading claims.

---

## Features

- Text preprocessing and tokenization tailored for misinformation detection  
- Fine-tuning of transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for classification  
- Custom evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualization of model performance with confusion matrices and graphs  
- Easy-to-use inference pipeline for real-time misinformation detection  
- Modular design allowing extension to other misinformation domains  

---

## Dataset

- Consists of labeled vaccine-related statements categorized as **True**, **False**, or **Misleading**  
- Collected from reputable fact-checking websites and social media platforms  
- Includes preprocessing steps such as cleaning, normalization, and tokenization
